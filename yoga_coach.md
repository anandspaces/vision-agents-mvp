# Yoga Practice and Alignment Guide

## 1. Introduction
A yoga teacher’s primary goal is to guide the student toward a safe union of breath and movement. While every body is anatomically unique, the principles of alignment ensure safety and energy flow.

 Coaches should monitor the "foundation" (what touches the floor), the spine's length, and the fluidity of the breath. The following guidelines break down the practice into key components.

## 2. The Breath (Pranayama)
Breath is the anchor of the practice. Without breath, it is just gymnastics. Coaches should listen for and encourage Ujjayi breath (ocean breath)—deep inhalations and exhalations through the nose. If a student is holding their breath, they are likely straining or pushing too hard. Remind them: "If you cannot breathe in the pose, ease out of the pose."

## 3. Foundation and Grounding
Just as a grip controls the club, the hands and feet control the asana. In standing poses, ensure the four corners of the feet are rooted. In arm balances or Down Dog, fingers should be spread wide with weight distributed through the knuckles, not crashing into the wrists. A solid foundation creates lightness in the rest of the body.

## 4. Drishti (Gaze) and Neck Alignment
Where the eyes go, the energy flows. Students often crane their necks to look around, disrupting spinal alignment. Coaches should cue a soft, steady gaze (Drishti) specific to each pose—usually forward, up, or toward the navel. Keep the neck long and essentially an extension of the spine; avoid "turtling" the shoulders up to the ears.

## 5. Tadasana (Mountain Pose)
This is the blueprint for all standing postures. Coaches should check for a neutral pelvis (tailbone neither tucked nor flared), engaged quads (lifting the kneecaps), and shoulders rolled back and down. The palms should face forward to open the chest. If Tadasana is slumped, the complex poses will suffer.

## 6. Downward Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana)
The quintessential reset pose.

 Key checkpoints: hands shoulder-width, feet hip-width, and an inverted "V" shape. Coaches should prioritize a long spine over straight legs—it is better to bend the knees than to round the back. Watch for shoulders collapsing near the ears; cue "rotate the triceps inward" to broaden the upper back.

## 7. Warrior Poses (Virabhadrasana)
In Warrior I and II, the front knee must track directly over the ankle, never drifting inward (which risks injury). The back leg should be straight and strong. In Warrior II, ensure the torso is stacked vertically over the hips, not leaning forward toward the front knee. Shoulders should remain relaxed away from the ears.

## 8. Forward Folds (Uttanasana)
Forward folds are about lengthening the back body, not just touching toes. Coaches should watch for rounding in the upper back. Encourage students to hinge from the hips. If the hamstrings are tight, cue a generous bend in the knees to maintain contact between the belly and thighs. This protects the lower back (lumbar spine).

## 9. Backbends
Backbends energize the body but require safety. Whether in Cobra, Upward Dog, or Wheel, the bend should be distributed evenly through the entire spine, not "dumped" into the lower back. Coaches should emphasize engaging the glutes and inner thighs to support the lumbar region and lifting the chest through the arms.

## 10. Balances (Tree, Eagle, Dancer)
Balance requires a quiet mind and a strong core.  If a student wobbles, check their gaze (Drishti) and their standing foot. In Tree Pose, ensure the foot is placed on the calf or inner thigh, *never* directly on the knee joint. Remind them that falling is part of the practice; the return to balance is where the yoga happens.

## 11. Savasana and Release
The final resting pose is where integration happens. Coaches should ensure the student looks fully relaxed: feet splayed open, palms up, eyes closed. If they appear fidgety or tense, guide them to soften the jaw and forehead. This is the moment to stop "doing" and start "being."

## 12. Common Misalignments and Fixes
Most issues stem from a lack of core engagement or tight hips/shoulders.
* **Shoulders hiking up:** Cue "slide shoulder blades down the back."
* **Hyperextended elbows/knees:** Cue a "micro-bend" in the joint.
* **Collapsed arches:** Cue "lift the inner ankles."
* **Holding breath:** Cue a deep exhale.
Rather than correcting every flaw, focus on the safety of the joints and the length of the spine.
